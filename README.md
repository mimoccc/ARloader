Augmented Reality 3D model for Android
======================================

With this Android app you can load up simple Wavefront .obj files and explore them in augmented reality space.

Technology
----------

I'm using the Qualcomm QCAR SDK to track patterns and render 3D models with OpenGL.

Status
------

I started this from the ImageTargets example which comes with the QCAR SDK. For now I'm able to load up obj files but I'm having troubles loading textures from the NDK.
